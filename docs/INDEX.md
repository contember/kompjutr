# kompjutr docs — index

The map of everything under `docs/`. Read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the rules.
When sources disagree, precedence is: invariants/hard-rules → active sprint →
decisions → reference → archive.

## Folders

- [`reference/`](reference/README.md) — how the system works now.
- [`ideas/`](ideas/README.md) — proposals, no commitment.
- [`decisions/`](decisions/README.md) — ADRs (the *why*), immutable.
- [`backlog/`](backlog/README.md) — decided work, not yet scheduled.
- [`sprints/`](sprints/README.md) — active thematic work-plans.
- [`archive/`](archive/README.md) — shipped sprints + reference-worthy records.

## Active sprints

- [`sprints/sprint-2026-08-26-reflogs-and-ref-recovery.md`](sprints/sprint-2026-08-26-reflogs-and-ref-recovery.md)
  — transactional ref history, bounded recovery APIs, and future GC roots.
- [`sprints/sprint-2026-08-26-e2e-journeys.md`](sprints/sprint-2026-08-26-e2e-journeys.md)
  — whole-workflow tests played against the git binary, step by step.

## What's hot

<!-- hand-maintained, keep short: the few things actually in motion + what's next.
     If everything is "hot", nothing is. -->
- Recovery is active: reflogs and ref recovery precede merged-branch deletion
  and destructive repository maintenance.
